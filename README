What is this
------------

  This module allows you to hide a file by encrypting it and then attaching
  it to another file of your choice.  This mimetic file then looks and
  behaves like a normal file, and can be stored, used or emailed without
  attracting attention.

  Although this could be considered a steganography program, it implements
  a very very trivial steganography.
  A lot of steganography programs use smarter methods, but they can hide
  only few informations in big files.
  I wrote this module because it can be used to hide big files behind
  little ones; obviously a gif larger than 5MB could be souspicious, but
  a doc or a pdf with the same size should not attract attention.


New versions

Requirements
------------
  _____________________________________
  Perl5 - http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/
  
  OK, you should know enough about it.

  _______________________________________
  Some Perl modules - http://www.cpan.org

  Crypt::Mimetic needs following modules:
   Term::ReadKey
   File::Copy
   File::Find
   Error
  (probably you already have them)

  Mimetic supports some encryption algorithms:
   None - no extra modules required
   TEA - requires Crypt::Tea
   CipherSaber - requires Crypt::ChiperSaber
    

Installation
------------

  You can install it in usually way:
   # perl Makefile.PL
   # make
   # make test
   # make install


Made with...
------------
  ______
  Cygwin

  but I think that it should work on each OS with a normal Perl ditribution.

  ____
  Perl

  I used Perl because it has a lot of encryption algorithms in pure Perl and
  as C wrappers.


To do
-----
  1. Add a lot of encryption algorithms.
  2. Multiple files support.
  3. Write some demos and examples.
  4. Add API for comfortable user interfaces.
